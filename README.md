# Dittobnb

Dittbnb is a small iOS app designed to serve as an example of how Ditto's exported .strings files can be integrated into an iOS app. While Ditto supports many different ways to use variants, this project demonstrates how to use variants to aide in localizing a mobile application.

### ðŸ›  Initial setup
This project was tested using Xcode 13.

2. Open Dittobnb.xcodeproj
3. Hit the run button to boot Dittobnb onto your simulator!

The project is setup to use the system language on the machine it's running on. To force a specific language do the following steps:
